Part 1:
	The code outputs the correct dominators. To test this I created another java file that was easier to follow through with the output. This was created from one of the slides in the lectures. The output matched with the results in the lecture and thus the code is correct. 

Part 2:
	PTA total edges: 7
	PTA time: 1527ms
	CHA total edges: 12
	CHA time: 1494ms

	CHA is faster in it's executution, but it is not as precise as PHA. This is because PHA has every call relationship that occurs and also some calls that would not normally happen in the program.
